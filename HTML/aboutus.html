                <h2>Welcome To Our Website</h2>
                <p>UsasOne is an organization which works towards making STEM accessible to everyone. We work together to break down stereotypes and income inequalities by advocating and creating fundraisers. Our goal is to ensure more people hear about opportunities within their area and expand their network with people with their dream career. By promoting STEM, we ensure that the next generation gets insight on potential career paths while writing, researching, editing, designing, and learning about STEM topics. We will work with youth to ensure they are able to learn about potential topics and assist them with spreading their name in society by making blogs, journals, and posts. We hope that one day numerous people will pursue STEM careers without the fear of income inequalities, networking issues, and discrimination.
